### Matplotlib Gallery

This repository contains (non-easy) examples of Matplotlib generated plots, animations, and applications (mostly in mathematics and applied mathematics area). The examples here are not intended for beginners, although beginners might understand them.


**Preview:**

1.) Here is an example of an animation made using only Matplotlib, about the Little Big Planet character Sackboy (see the code in Examples/Sackboy Animation). I added a functionality such that everytime we click on the figure it will change the background color.
