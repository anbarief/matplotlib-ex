### Matplotlib Gallery

This repository contains (non-easy) examples of Matplotlib generated plots, animations, and applications (will mostly in mathematics and applied mathematics area). The documentation for each code is still in progress. I am the author of all the code here (unless stated otherwise). Feel free to contact me at anbarief@live.com.

Here is an example of an animation made using only Matplotlib, about the Little Big Planet character Sackboy (see the code in "Examples/Sackboy Animation"). I added a functionality such that everytime we click on the figure it will change the background color.
