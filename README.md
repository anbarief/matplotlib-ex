### Matplotlib-EX 

This repository contains my examples of Matplotlib generated plots, data visualizations, animations, and applications (will mostly in mathematics and applied mathematics area). The examples range from easy to difficult. The documentation for each code is still in progress. I am the author of all the code here (unless stated otherwise). Some examples also require dataset files, which are already available in the folder except for large size dataset files. Some examples also require other external libraries such as **Pandas**, **Numpy**, and **Scikit-learn**. Feel free to contact me at anbarief@live.com.

**Preview:**

This is my submission in the WDVP 2019 (World Data Visualization Prize). The `wdvp_squares_model.py` generates the pdf file, `wdvp_squares.pdf`, without plotting the visualization (because using `fig.show` will get different text size in comparison to the saved plot in pdf format). See the code and the pdf file here: "Examples/World Data Visualization Prize 2019/"

A plot of 2-step sequence of 4-digit positive integer Kaprekar routine. The Kaprekar routine for 4-digit positive integer always converge to the number 6174, or Kaprekar's constant. (provided that not all digits are the same)

Here is an example of an animation made using only Matplotlib, about the Little Big Planet character Sackboy (see the code in "Examples/Sackboy Animation"). I added a functionality such that everytime we click on the figure it will change the background color.
